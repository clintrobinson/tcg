/* @file
 * This file is a custom file that loads all files. Each non-base layer

 * Do not name this file "STARTER.scss". This file should be named
 * THEMENAME.scss. If you used the drush command to generate this subtheme,
 * it should be named for you.
 *
 * This application file (THEMENAME.scss) is where all the partials are
 * imported.
 *
 * Theme styles are categorized using SMACSS standards. They utilize
 * categorization of styles into various categories. Those categories are the
 * following:
 *
 * - Base: CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
 * - Layout: Macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
 * - Modules: Dictate minor layout modules or reusable elements.
 * - States: Describe the appearance of a module in various states.
 * - Theme: Specific customizations for your subtheme.
 * For more information about this new Drupal css file standard, please review
